# SteelHacks_2016

## Inspiration
First Hackathon, Oculus Rift, no experience with Unity, you could say we were a little ambitious.

## What it does
SpaceGame hosts an open Unity scene featuring a dazzling, starry skybox, where the player is entertained by a simplistic model of a solar system, slowly orbiting around a central star.

## How we built it
Our primary platform was Unity. We created a scene populated with objects (primarily the Unity PrimitiveSphere) and scripted different movement patterns in C#. We were able to integrate the Oculus Rift as the camera view for the player.

## Challenges we ran into
1. Directing the player's movement with the position of the Oculus headset.
2. Learning how Unity works alongside C# (and learning C#)
3. github not wanting to work well with all the files associated with Unity

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We came with no idea, but were able to make a simple program that takes advantage of the Oculus Rift. Although it was simple, everyone who tried it loved the experience thanks to the Oculus immersion.

## What we learned
The basic workings of Unity and some C#, as well as the utilization of Oculus Rift as a display.

## What's next for SpaceGame
Implementing more interactive features, lending it a more game-like feel.
